#### I build web applications and mobile apps

<p>
  I am a software engineer who strives for test-driven development, translating business requirements into technical requirements, and an agile based development model.
</p>
<p>
  I consider these to be the primary elements for delivering quality and maintainable software with high-confidence.
</p>
<p>
  In the past, I was a lead photographer for a magazine in Portland, and operated a wedding photography business.
