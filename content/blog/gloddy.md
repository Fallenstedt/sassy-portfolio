# Introducing Glossy

[Glossy](https://glossy.dev) is a tool that helps you document your code so that you can share it with others. 

Just paste your code, add comments directly into the code, and then export. Glossy makes it easy to explain what some piece of code does by using an ordered list of annotations. Simply write inline comments so that your audience is never confused about your snippet of code. Glossy does not require any specific compiler or unique markup language. It’s flexible and very straightforward! 

# Create a shareable image from your source code complete with annotations. 

I’ve used Carbon, Gists, and screenshots to share my documented code in the past, but I always wished for more from these tools. In searching for a stable tool that could generate documented code snippets for my blog, I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to be able to provide a written explanation of my code that was easily and visibly connected to the referenced line of code.

Because the Glossy editor uses numbered annotations, you can see which part of the code you are referring to as you write out the annotated explanation. When you are done annotating your code, export as PNG or Markdown. Simple!
