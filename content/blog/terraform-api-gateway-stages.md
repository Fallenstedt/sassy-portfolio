## The Problem

API Gateway allows you to assocate deployments with stages, each stage representing a logical reference of your api. For example, my gardentour API project needs a `dev` and a `prod` stage to represent my environments. 

I manage infrastructure with terraform, and I needed to achieve full isolation of my stages. It would be impracticable to manage deploys of many API Gateway stages with a single Terraform environment like so: 

```
terraform/
├─ main.tf
├─ modules/
│  ├─ api-gateway/
│  │  ├─ main.tf
│  │  ├─ variables.tf
│  │  ├─ outputs.tf
│  ├─ api-gateway-stage/
│  │  ├─ main.tf
│  │  ├─ variables.tf
│  │  ├─ outputs.tf
```

Assuming the `main.tf` for terraform used a single `api-gateway` and multiple `api-gateway-stages`, I would be locked to single deployment for all of my stages. My `dev` stage would not be independent of my `prod` stage. 


## The Solution

By creating separate Terraform environments for each stage, you can more easily manage and isolate changes to your API Gateway deployments. Your `dev` environment be worked on independently of your `test` environment, or your `prod` environmnet. Terraform environments can be isolated by placing environment specific infrastructure into its own directory.

This approach had a major benefit of knowing which environment was being worked on, and limited myself from messing up my entire project with an accidental deploy.


```
terraform/
├─ global/
│  ├─ api-gateway/
│  │  ├─ main.tf
├─ dev/
│  ├─ main.tf
├─ prod/
│  ├─ main.tf
├─ modules/
│  ├─ api-gateway/
│  │  ├─ main.tf
│  │  ├─ variables.tf
│  │  ├─ outputs.tf
│  ├─ api-gateway-stage/
│  │  ├─ main.tf
│  │  ├─ variables.tf
```

There are three environments and one modules directory:

* `global` refers to infrastructure that is available across all environments. These can include my IAM roles, Route53 domains and hosted zones, or a global API Gateway instance. 

* `dev` would reference the global API Gateway instance as a `data` source. This environment would add a `dev` stage to the API Gateway. 

* `prod` would also reference the global API Gateway instance as a `data` source, and add a `prod` stage to it.

* `modules` are terraform modules that encapsulate the volatility of some piece of infrastructure. These modules are used across all environments.

This directory structure keeps the lifecycle of my API Gateway stages independent, while using a single API Gateway instance.
